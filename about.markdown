SOBRE NÓS
CHI TAU
Founded by Brazilian Fulbright FLTA Jeferson Barboza Torres and Dr. Steven Butterman,
Chi Tau is the Phi Lambda Beta chapter at The University of Miami. 
Our chapter aims at narrowing the relationship of Portuguese language speakers at the university and extending it to a national level. Furthermore, we hope to promote events about the different cultures of the Portuguese language, provide scholarships in the area, besides offering an exclusive database of jobs and internships for our members.

If you are a student of Portuguese or if you are interested in the language and cultures of Portuguese speaking countries, join us and take advantage of all the opportunities Phi Lambda Beta can offer to its members!
